# 🏰 Guild: Enterprise AI Agent Framework

> **One developer managing multiple concurrent enterprise projects**  
> **Current acceleration: 10-20x per project (based on internal testing)**

## What is Guild?

Guild is a modular, multi-agent AI framework built in Go, designed to automate complex development tasks by orchestrating specialized AI agents ("artisans"). Each artisan handles roles like coding, reviewing, or testing, collaborating seamlessly to achieve ambitious technical objectives.

**The Vision:** Enable one developer to deliver results traditionally requiring entire development teams, across multiple concurrent projects.

## 🏗️ Key Components

- **Agents (Artisans)**: Specialized AI workers handling distinct roles
- **Guild-Core**: Coordinates agents, task distribution, and workflow orchestration
- **Guild-Corpus**: Knowledge management and retrieval (RAG) to enhance agent intelligence
- **Guild-TUI**: Interactive terminal UI for managing tasks and agent interactions
- **Guild-MCP**: Model Context Protocol integration with both client and server capabilities for seamless tool and service connectivity
- **Guild-Prompt-Storage**: Secure, version-controlled prompt management via Git

## 🚀 Key Benefits

### **Unprecedented Productivity**

- **10-20x acceleration** per project (validated in pilot projects)
- **Concurrent management** of multiple projects by a single developer
- **Automated execution** of complex development workflows

### **High-Performance Features**

- **Advanced cost optimization** and real-time budget tracking
- **Comprehensive audit logging** for development transparency
- **Secure sandboxed environments** for reliable execution
- **Production-grade reliability** at startup speed

### **Developer Experience**

- **Simple, intuitive interfaces** to manage tasks and workflows
- **Engaging guild-themed terminology** ("artisans" for agents, "commissions" for tasks) makes complex workflows easy to understand
- **Modular, extensible architecture** supports rapid integration and scaling

## 📊 Development Progress

**Framework Status (70% of MVP milestones achieved):**

### **Claude Code Development & Testing**

- 🔧 Extensive Claude Code usage driving Guild design refinement
- ✅ 3 productivity tools built during development process (saving 1+ month annually)
- 🔧 60K+ lines of production-grade Go Python and Lua code generated through Claude Code workflows in last month
- ✅ Claude Code and Max plan integrated into framework

### **Core Framework Development**

- 🔧 Agent orchestration architecture designed and partially implemented
- 🔧 Multi-project management system in development
- 🔧 RAG and knowledge management foundation established
- 🔧 Agent specialization and workflow automation (in progress)

**Current Focus:** Transitioning from Claude Code-powered development to full Guild framework implementation

## 🎯 Ideal Applications

Guild excels for organizations that prioritize speed, innovation, and breakthrough productivity:

- **Crypto/Web3 protocols and infrastructure**
- **High-growth startups scaling rapidly**
- **Infrastructure companies building at scale**
- **Developer tooling and platform companies**
- **Any organization where 30x development acceleration provides competitive advantage**

Perfect for teams that move fast, embrace cutting-edge technology, and need to ship complex products quickly.

## 💼 Early Access & Partnership

Guild is currently in private development with limited availability for early-access partnerships.

**We are seeking:**

- **Fast-moving organizations** ready to pilot breakthrough productivity tools
- **Startups and scale-ups** needing rapid development acceleration
- **Crypto/Web3 companies** building complex infrastructure
- **Technical leaders** exploring next-generation development frameworks
