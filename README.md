## 1 Why Guild Exists

Traditional Web3 startups burn months recruiting and coordinating engineers.  
**Guild's proprietary Agent Framework transforms development velocity** – turning weeks into days and enabling parallel venture development at unprecedented scale.

**The moment is now:** AI coding matured + cheap Web3 infrastructure + $500M+ unclaimed grant capital = massive execution advantage.
